## R Markdown

This R markdown document shows the code used to generate the results of assignment 3 in algorithms for functional genomics, COMP90014, semester 2 - 2016.

```{r libraries}
library(edgeR)
library(locfit)
library(gridExtra)
library(grid)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
